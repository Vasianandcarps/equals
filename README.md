# Idee 
This website is designed for solving equations (quadratic). It is suitable for school students and college students to check the correctness of equation solutions. It does not provide a full solution but only gives the Discriminant (D) and the values of x₁ and x₂. When the `D=0`, `x₁` and `x₂` are equal to each other.
